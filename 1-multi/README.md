# Hashtable
This is a version of a hashtable in C.
It uses a double linked list for multiple entries. In the assignment these are called "buckets". 
The program takes the input either from the stdin, or one or more files. It runs the commands sequentially on the same hashtable.

## Getting Started
You cand find the assignment [here](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/so/teme/tema-1). As stated in the [root Readme file](../README.md), it's in Romanian.
The project is specifically written to be one code that runs on both Linux and Windows. One code to rule them all.
To achieve this, the ISO C standard is used. 

### Prerequisites
For the project to run, you absolutely have to make sure your platform has at least the same general specifications as specified in the ```Prerequisites``` section of the [root Readme file](../README.md).

### Installing
See [root Readme file](../README.md).

### Testing
This project does not diverge from the [root Readme file's](../README.md) general rule.
