# Minishell
The assignment was proposed for us to familiarise ourselves with processes execution.
The project is a mini version of a Unix like bash. It can execute processes, use environment variables, secventiate commands and redirect their output.

## Overall info
The assignment's text can be found [here](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/so/teme/tema-2). The language is Romanian.
I used a really nicely written parser, kindly provided by the course's stuff. I have a feeling I would've stumbled myself in the [muddy waters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6SprGmHTy4) for quite some time without it.

## Other
For every other information, please refer to the [root's Readme file](../Readme.md). It contains all the informations one would need to get familiarised with the project's scope and deployment
