## Getting Stared
This repo is based on the [course's stuff's one](https://github.com/systems-cs-pub-ro/so-assignments).

[Here](https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/so) you can find the assignments with all the specifics and the constraints. 
If otherwise specified in the homework's Readme file, the homework obedes all of the constraints. 
Assignment's text is in the Romanian.
